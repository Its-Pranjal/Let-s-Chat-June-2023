## 3. Why Choose These Technologies

Choosing the right technologies is critical for project success. Here's why we selected these technologies:

### React.js

React.js offers a component-based architecture that makes building user interfaces efficient and maintainable. Its virtual DOM ensures optimal performance.

### Node.js and Express.js

Node.js and Express.js provide a scalable and robust backend environment. They enable fast development and efficient server-side operations.

### MongoDB and Mongoose

MongoDB's flexibility and scalability are ideal for storing various types of data. Mongoose simplifies working with MongoDB in a Node.js environment.

### bcrypt and jsonwebtoken

bcrypt ensures secure password hashing, while jsonwebtoken handles authentication with JSON Web Tokens, enhancing user data protection.

### Multer-GridFS-Storage

Efficiently store large media files in MongoDB using Multer-GridFS-Storage.

### Material Icons

Material Icons offer a modern and visually appealing design for the user interface.

## 4. Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) installed and running.
